# Tool-Ahead-of-Time-TypeScript (TAoT-ts): Because Why Wait? 🕒
Ever found yourself staring at a shiny new LLM through LangChain's window, but can't use tool calling because it's "not supported yet"? 

*Sad agent noises* 😢

Well, hold my JSON parser, because this repo says "NOT TODAY!" 🦾

## What is this sorcery? 🧙‍♂️

This is a TypeScript package (a package mirrowing the equivalent Python package: https://github.com/leockl/tool-ahead-of-time) that enables tool calling for any model available through Langchain's ChatOpenAI library (and by extension, any model available through OpenAI's library), even before LangChain and LangGraph officially supports it! 

Yes, you read that right. We're living in the age of AI and things move fast 🏎️💨

It essentially works by reformatting the output response of the model into a JSON parser and passing this on to the relevant tools.

This repo showcases an example with DeepSeek-R1 671B (hosted on the OpenRouter platform), which isn't currently supported with tool calling by LangChain and LangGraph (as of 16th Feb 2025).

## Features 🌟

- Tool calling support for OpenAI and non-OpenAI models available on Langchain's ChatOpenAI library (and by extension, OpenAI and non-OpenAI models available on the base OpenAI's library).
- This package follows a similar method to LangChain's and LangGraph's `create_react_agent` method for tool calling, so makes it easy for you to read the syntax. 😊
- Zero waiting for official support required.
- More robust than a caffeinated developer at 3 AM. ☕
